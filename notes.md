â€¢ Incorporate risk tolerance assessments to tailor investment strategies
â€¢ Add scenario planning features (e.g., what if I increase my monthly contribution by 10%?)
â€¢ Include visual elements like graphs to show projected growth over time

One thing that could really set this calculator apart is integrating real-time market data or AI-driven predictions. It gives users a more dynamic and realistic view of their investment potential.

Have you considered adding a feature for comparing different investment vehicles (e.g., 401k vs. Roth IRA)? That could be super helpful for users weighing their options.

Keep up the great work! Tools like these are so important for empowering people to take control of their financial futures. ðŸ’ªðŸ’¼
