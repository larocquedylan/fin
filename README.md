# Budget Tool and Investment Calculator

Built this app to help my girlfriend visualize her budget and investment goals.

A calculator that shows the future value of initial investment, contributions, contribution frequency, time horizon, annual growth rate

## Next Steps?

- Add scenario planning features (e.g., what if I increase my monthly contribution by 10%?)
- Risk tolerance assessment: Help users understand their comfort level with market volatility
- Multiple goal tracking: Allow users to input several financial goals simultaneously
- Tax implications: Factor in potential tax consequences of different investment strategies
- Scenario planning: Let users compare different investment approaches side-by-side
- A calculator that shows the future value of investments, taking into account contributions, growth rates, and compounding interest.
